HW #3
--------
This folder contains three separate python scripts:
* hw3_a.py
* hw3_b.py
* hw3_c.py

hw3_a & hw3_b generate plots reproduce Figure_HW3.pdf & stocks.png, respectively. 
hw3_c.py is a brushing code for the iris dataset (flower.csv)


HW#3 part A
--------
Running hw3_a.py will reproduce the figure shown in Figure_HW3a_matlab.pdf, originally plotted in Matlab. 
The output figure of the python code is saved in Figure_HW3a_python.png.  

HW#3 part B
--------
Running hw3_b.py will reproduce the figure shown in stocks.png. The output figure of that file is saved in stocks_copy.png


HW#3 part C
--------
Running hw3_c.py will allow brushing for the flowers.csv data set. The code has the following features:

* Plots the iris dataset in a 4x4 grid
* Allows you to interactively draw rectangles on one of the subplots
* Identifyies the datapoints located within the drawn rectangle
* Changes the color/opacities of the corresponding points in the other subplots 

After drawing a rectangle, hitting 'd' from a keyboard will remove the brushed region, regardless of where the mouse is. 
Only one brushing rectangle can be viewed at a time.
